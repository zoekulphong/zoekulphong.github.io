        <p class="body-text challenge-description">Redesigning an entire app is a highly involved process. Viridia had not previously invested in real design work. Their app lacked a visually pleasing user interface and had several problems that were identified throughout the app and addressed in this redesign.</p>

Each task can be opened for more information and can also be marked as complete.<br><br>The main problems with the Home page’s previous design were aesthetic. In this redesign, tasks open as pop-ups, and can be marked as complete from this pop-up. This creates more continuity within the app. The option to edit the task’s description and frequency directly from the home page was added to simplify the number of steps in this user flow. Plant birthdays were added to allow users to easily track the growth of their plants.</p>

Not all plants were directly accessible via the Explore page. Additionally, there was no way to sort plants, and they did not have adequate information. Adding a plant was overwhelming, and the call to action to add a plant to the user’s garden was buried within the page.<br><br>In this redesign, all plants are showcased directly on the Explore page and can be sorted by collection. More information for each plant was added. Adding a plant now opens as a pop-up and is broken down into easy-to-digest steps.</p>

The process of editing a plant was broken down into multiple sections and now presents as a pop-up for continuity. It is now easy to edit the notification time of an individual plant, and users can easily find plants similar to those in their gardens.</p>

A star was previously used, but did not fit the design of the app. Additionally, the process of adding a plant to the user’s garden was not clear.<br><br>In the redesign, the star was changed to a heart icon. As when adding plants from other pages, a clear call to action to add a plant to the user’s garden was included and this process was broken down into multiple sections and now opens as a pop-up for simplicity.</p>
